- BUG: Parse error being sent to mail by cron. Presumed to be caused by characters in channel status. `parse error: Invalid numeric literal at line 1, column 20`
- Handle DISPLAY for kdialog_notify
- Re-implement debug functionality
- Re-implement command line arguments for passing custom lists. Currently, this has to be done via a new settings file.
- Modify the pushbullet notifier to handle other services correctly for uri.
- Add azubu.tv as a service. http://content.azubu.tv/api/
